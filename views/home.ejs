        <h4> Photographers </h4>
        <p> Let's face it. No, really, let's face it. Your landscape shots are beautiful, but it's hard to match the energy that an expressive face brings to a photo. Flakey models got you down? At Creative Collective you will be surrounded by enthusiastic talent bringing their own ideas and vibe to the table. Make up artists will be there to help you bring out the feeling that's been missing in your work lately.</p>

        <h4> Models </h4>
        <p> The selfies just aren't cutting it anymore. Whether you're new to the modeling industry in need of portfolio building shots, or a seasoned veteran wanting to work with concepts outside the confines of paid commercial work, all are welcome to put their heads (or in this case, faces) together to shoot with highly creative individuals. And no need to worry about make-up, MUA's will be on site to tie it all together.  </p>

        <h4> MUA's </h4>
        <p>Meet the smiling (or pouting) faces that will be your talents canvas. Stop asking your sister to model for you, stop getting handcramps from painting your own face at awkward angles. Be inspired by the features of new individuals. Work together with photographers and come up with fresh, exciting concepts to bring your vision to life.   </p>
